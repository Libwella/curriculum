Curriculum
==========

In an effort to share best practice and develop the highest quality educational content possible, I’m opening up the process of developing a new BDes (Hons) Interaction Design course, which I’m developing at the University of Ulster. Web design education has, rightly, been criticised for its lack of engagement with industry; I believe sharing course content on GitHub can offer us new ways to engage with other educational institutes and with industry.

This is an experiment, there might be elements you disagree with, and that's fine. I’d welcome your input, but please engage with it constructively. Feel free to <a href="mailto:chris.murphy@ulster.ac.uk?subject=Open Curriculum on GitHub">email me</a> with your thoughts. —[Christopher Murphy](https://twitter.com/fehler)
