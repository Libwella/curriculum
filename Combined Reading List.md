<!-- This is incomplete, I'm gathering all of the course reading lists into one, combined, list here. I hope to have this completed by close of play on Tuesday, 21 January, 2014. -->

We'd recommend the following books are read in alignment with the respective module content, however, this list provides a detailed overview of the BDes (Hons) Interaction Design course reading list, broken down by year.
